#QGS Landing Page

_November 1, 2016_

##### Summary
This is the landing page for QGS. It will be modified or replaced with something more suiting to operating. But we know what they say about first impressions.

##### Setup
To set up locally, ensure you have Node installed. Within the repository directory on your machine...

1. Run `npm install` in your console.
2. Run `gulp` to compile & minify the javascript and sass. (Refer to `gulpfile.js` for a list of other tasks.
3. To view, either simply open `build/index.html` or descend into the `build/` directory and run:

* On Mac/Linux with PHP installed: `php -s localhost:3000` and enter the same address in your browser.
* On Windows with Node installed, run `npm install -g live-server` and then run by entering `live-server` at the command prompt. Enter the address it echos in your browser.
